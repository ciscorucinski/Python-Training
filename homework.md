## Week 4

This week, you were taught that computers don't work with random numbers of bits. They read a certain number of bits each time. The oldest computers read **8 bits** at a time. Today, 64-bit computers will only read **64 bits** at a time; not 63, not 8, just 64-bits.

For this reason, whenever you write in binary, you should write *8 bits at a time* ( 0100 1101 ) divided into 2 groups of 4 bits.

**Fun Fact:** a group of 4 bits is called a **nibble**.

### Terminology

Define the following terms 

 - [x] `bit`
 - [x] `byte`
 
 **Also** give a few examples of the following 
 
 - [x] `digits` - these are single numeral values of a base *(i.e base-10)* that make up numbers. <br /> **Examples:** `0`, `1`, ..., `9` 
 
 - [x] `int`
 - [x] `float`
 - [x] `char`
 - [x] `String`
 
 - [x] `overflow`
 
 ### Questions
 
Decimal numbers are in base-10 and use 10 digits (0 - 9). This is a human-centered number system mostly because humans have 10 fingers. Computers don't have fingers and use a different base.
 
 - [x] What is the main base that computers use?
 
Humans CAN use base-10 numbers when writing software; the computer will simply convert it to base-2 for you. However, if humans have to work with bits / bytes, they don't use base-10, and they usually don't use base-2 because you have to type a lot of zeros and ones. So, humans use a different base when working with bits / bytes.

 - [x] What is the base that humans usually use when working with bits and bytes? <br /> **Hint: it is a 'power of 2'**
 - [x] What is the name of 'that base'? <br /> **Note: Base-10 is called 'decimal'**
 - [x] What are the digits of 'that base'?
 - [x] What is the prefix to tell the computer this is a number in 'that base'? <br /> **Note: Binary numbers have the prefix `0b` (zero-b) (i.e. `0b10000000`)** <br /> **This number is binary `1000 0000`, not decimal `10,000,000` (ten million)**
 
 ### Base Conversion
 Numbers have `digits` and are in specific `positions`. The number `280` has 3 digits `2`, `8`, and `0`. The `0` is in the `ones` position, `8` in the `tens` position, and `2` in the `hundreds` position.

 #### Binary to Decimal Conversion
 This conversion is easier to calculate. When going from a smaller base to a larger base all you need is addition.
 
 Do the following conversions into `decimal`
 
  - [x] 0000 0011
  - [x] 0000 0110
  - [x] 0000 1100
  - [x] 0111 0000
  - [x] 1110 0000
 
 ##### Pattern Review 
 Look at the 1st three and the last two. What patterns do you notice?
 
 - [x] What do you notice about their decimal values?
 - [x] What do you notice about their binary values?
 
 #### Decimal to Binary Conversion
 
 This conversion is a little harder to calculate. When going from a bigger base to a smaller base you need to use subtraction with a running-tally.
 
 Do the following conversions into `binary`. Should be easy if you found the pattern in the previous section!!
 
- [x] 13
- [x] 26 **Note: this is `13 * 2`**. 
- [x] 52 **Note: this is `13 * 4` or `13 * 2 * 2`**.
- [x] 127
- [x] 128
- [x] 31415962 **Note: Go to [Google](google.com) and type in the search box `31415962 to binary`. Google will give you the answer!! Don't forget to remove the `0b` prefix**

- [x] 31415962 **Note: Give me the number as 4 bytes (32 bits) with spaces between each nibble (i.e. 2 bytes -> 0000 0000 0000 0000)**

#### Ascii Conversion
Look at this [Ascii chart](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) and do the following conversion

 - [x] 97 to Ascii
 - [x] 65 to Ascii
 - [x] 0110 1111 to Ascii
 - [x] 0100 1111 to Ascii

Last Friday, we downloaded and installed 2 items

 - **JetBrains Toolbox App:** JetBrain is the name of a company that makes software for developers. JetBrains Toolbox is an app that is like a software manager for all JetBrain's products. It lets you launch their IDE's and your software projects in one spot. It also lets you easily update all the IDE's in one spot.
 
 - **PyCharm:** an IDE that has all the tools required for a person or team to write, test, and run many different types of Python programs.
 
We still need to download one more piece of software so you can actually write Python programs.

 - [ ] [Python 3.6 SDK](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure you select Python 3.6+ (NOT 2.7+). Use all default locations for installation!

### Quick review of last week's homework

- [ ] Base-10 uses the numerals `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. What are the numerals of `Hexidecimal`?
- [ ] Binary numbers use the prefix `0b`. What is the prefix of `Hexidecimal` numbers?

- [ ] Give me 3 examples of the following `int`, `float`, `char`, `string`, `byte` <br /> **Example of integer is `1`**

Computers only read bytes. A 32-bit computer will read 4 bytes at a time (8 bits * 4 = 32 bits). An 8-bit computer will only read 1 byte at a time. 

- [ ] Give the number `13` as a 1-byte number.
- [ ] Convert the 1 byte number above to 2 bytes.
- [ ] Convert the 1 byte number above to 3 bytes.
- [ ] Convert the 1 byte number above to 4 bytes.

- [ ] Give the number `31415962` as a 4-byte number.
- [ ] Convert the 4 byte number `314159623` to 2 bytes. <br />**Note:** Use Microsoft Calculator or Google Search to convert this number
- [ ] Convert the 4 byte binary number above to 1 byte (4 bytes -> 1 byte)
- [ ] Convert the 1 byte binary number above to decimal (`314159623` as 1 bytes to decimal) <br />**Note:** the number will change and will become a different and smaller number. It will NOT have the decimal value of `314159623` anymore.

Compare the above 1st four answers with the last four answers.
- [ ] What COULD happen if you convert a 4 byte number into a 3 byte (or 2 byte or 1 byte) number? Is that good or bad?
- [ ] What COULD happen if you convert a 1 byte number into a 2 byte (or 3 byte or 4 byte) number? Is that good or bad?

### Quick review of last week's videos

 `Machine code` is what computers "speak". In order for a computer to do something, machine code needs to be put in a computers memory. You saw this in an earlier video. Check out the `RAM` in the picture below...
 
 
 
 `Assembly code` is a version of machine code that is slightly more human-readable. Early programmers always programmed using Assembly code. Nowadays, Assembly code is rarely used. You also saw this in an earlier video. Check out the `RAM` in the picture below...
