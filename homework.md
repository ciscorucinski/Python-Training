## Week 4

This week, you were taught that computers don't work with random numbers of bits. They read a certain number of bits each time. The oldest computers read **8 bits** at a time. Today, 64-bit computers will only read **64 bits** at a time; not 63, not 8, just 64-bits.

For this reason, whenever you write in binary, you should write *8 bits at a time* ( 0100 1101 ) divided into 2 groups of 4 bits.

**Fun Fact:** a group of 4 bits is called a **nibble**.

### Terminology

Define the following terms 

 - [ ] `bit`
 - [ ] `byte`
 
 **Also** give a few examples of the following 
 
 - [x] `digits` - these are single numeral values of a base *(i.e base-10)* that make up numbers. <br /> **Examples:** `0`, `1`, ..., `9` 
 
 - [ ] `int`
 - [ ] `float`
 - [ ] `char`
 - [ ] `String`
 
 - [ ] `overflow`
 
 ### Questions
 
Decimal numbers are in base-10 and use 10 digits (0 - 9). This is a human-centered number system mostly because humans have 10 fingers. Computers don't have fingers and use a different base.
 
 - [ ] What is the main base that computers use?
 
Humans CAN use base-10 numbers when writing software; the computer will simply convert it to base-2 for you. However, if humans have to work with bits / bytes, they don't use base-10, and they usually don't use base-2 because you have to type a lot of zeros and ones. So, humans use a different base when working with bits / bytes.

 - [ ] What is the base that humans usually use when working with bits and bytes? <br /> **Hint: it is a 'power of 2'**
 - [ ] What is the name of 'that base'? <br /> **Note: Base-10 is called 'decimal'**
 - [ ] What are the digits of 'that base'?
 - [ ] What is the prefix to tell the computer this is a number in 'that base'? <br /> **Note: Binary numbers have the prefix `0b` (zero-b) (i.e. `0b10000000`)** <br /> **This number is binary `1000 0000`, not decimal `10,000,000` (ten million)**
 
 ### Base Conversion
 Numbers have `digits` and are in specific `positions`. The number `280` has 3 digits `2`, `8`, and `0`. The `0` is in the `ones` position, `8` in the `tens` position, and `2` in the `hundreds` position.

 #### Binary to Decimal Conversion
 This conversion is easier to calculate. When going from a smaller base to a larger base all you need is addition.
 
 Do the following conversions into `decimal`
 
  - [ ] 0000 0011
  - [ ] 0000 0110
  - [ ] 0000 1100
  - [ ] 0111 0000
  - [ ] 1110 0000
 
 ##### Pattern Review 
 Look at the 1st three and the last two. What patterns do you notice?
 
 - [ ] What do you notice about their decimal values?
 - [ ] What do you notice about their binary values?
 
 #### Decimal to Binary Conversion
 
 This conversion is a little harder to calculate. When going from a bigger base to a smaller base you need to use subtraction with a running-tally.
 
 Do the following conversions into `binary`. Should be easy if you found the pattern in the previous section!!
 
- [ ] 13
- [ ] 26 **Note: this is `13 * 2`**. 
- [ ] 52 **Note: this is `13 * 4` or `13 * 2 * 2`**.
- [ ] 127
- [ ] 128
- [ ] 31415962 **Note: Go to [Google](google.com) and type in the search box `31415962 to binary`. Google will give you the answer!! Don't forget to remove the `0b` prefix**

- [ ] 31415962 **Note: Give me the number as 4 bytes (32 bits) with spaces between each nibble (i.e. 2 bytes -> 0000 0000 0000 0000)**

#### Ascii Conversion
Look at this [Ascii chart](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) and do the following conversion

 - [ ] 97 to Ascii
 - [ ] 65 to Ascii
 - [ ] 0110 1111 to Ascii
 - [ ] 0100 1111 to Ascii
 
 <!--
 ##### Pattern Review
 Look at the Ascii values and the decimal or binary numbers from above...
 
 - [ ] What is the difference between `97` and `65`? **Note: do subtraction**
 - [ ] What is the difference between `0110 1111` and `0100 1111`? **Note: do subtraction (bit subtraction)**
 - [ ] What decimal value is the difference between `0110 1111` and `0100 1111`?
