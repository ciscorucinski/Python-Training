## Week 4

<details>
<summary>Click to expand...</summary>
 
This week, you were taught that computers don't work with random numbers of bits. They read a certain number of bits each time. The oldest computers read **8 bits** at a time. Today, 64-bit computers will only read **64 bits** at a time; not 63, not 8, just 64-bits.

For this reason, whenever you write in binary, you should write *8 bits at a time* ( 0100 1101 ) divided into 2 groups of 4 bits.

**Fun Fact:** a group of 4 bits is called a **nibble**.

### Terminology

Define the following terms 

 - [x] `bit`
 - [x] `byte`
 
 **Also** give a few examples of the following 
 
 - [x] `digits` - these are single numeral values of a base *(i.e base-10)* that make up numbers. <br /> **Examples:** `0`, `1`, ..., `9` 
 
 - [x] `int`
 - [x] `float`
 - [x] `char`
 - [x] `String`
 
 - [x] `overflow`
 
 ### Questions
 
Decimal numbers are in base-10 and use 10 digits (0 - 9). This is a human-centered number system mostly because humans have 10 fingers. Computers don't have fingers and use a different base.
 
 - [x] What is the main base that computers use?
 
Humans CAN use base-10 numbers when writing software; the computer will simply convert it to base-2 for you. However, if humans have to work with bits / bytes, they don't use base-10, and they usually don't use base-2 because you have to type a lot of zeros and ones. So, humans use a different base when working with bits / bytes.

 - [x] What is the base that humans usually use when working with bits and bytes? <br /> **Hint: it is a 'power of 2'**
 - [x] What is the name of 'that base'? <br /> **Note: Base-10 is called 'decimal'**
 - [x] What are the digits of 'that base'?
 - [x] What is the prefix to tell the computer this is a number in 'that base'? <br /> **Note: Binary numbers have the prefix `0b` (zero-b) (i.e. `0b10000000`)** <br /> **This number is binary `1000 0000`, not decimal `10,000,000` (ten million)**
 
 ### Base Conversion
 Numbers have `digits` and are in specific `positions`. The number `280` has 3 digits `2`, `8`, and `0`. The `0` is in the `ones` position, `8` in the `tens` position, and `2` in the `hundreds` position.

 #### Binary to Decimal Conversion
 This conversion is easier to calculate. When going from a smaller base to a larger base all you need is addition.
 
 Do the following conversions into `decimal`
 
  - [x] 0000 0011
  - [x] 0000 0110
  - [x] 0000 1100
  - [x] 0111 0000
  - [x] 1110 0000
 
 ##### Pattern Review 
 Look at the 1st three and the last two. What patterns do you notice?
 
 - [x] What do you notice about their decimal values?
 - [x] What do you notice about their binary values?
 
 #### Decimal to Binary Conversion
 
 This conversion is a little harder to calculate. When going from a bigger base to a smaller base you need to use subtraction with a running-tally.
 
 Do the following conversions into `binary`. Should be easy if you found the pattern in the previous section!!
 
- [x] 13
- [x] 26 **Note: this is `13 * 2`**. 
- [x] 52 **Note: this is `13 * 4` or `13 * 2 * 2`**.
- [x] 127
- [x] 128
- [x] 31415962 **Note: Go to [Google](google.com) and type in the search box `31415962 to binary`. Google will give you the answer!! Don't forget to remove the `0b` prefix**

- [x] 31415962 **Note: Give me the number as 4 bytes (32 bits) with spaces between each nibble (i.e. 2 bytes -> 0000 0000 0000 0000)**

#### Ascii Conversion
Look at this [Ascii chart](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) and do the following conversion

 - [x] 97 to Ascii
 - [x] 65 to Ascii
 - [x] 0110 1111 to Ascii
 - [x] 0100 1111 to Ascii

Last Friday, we downloaded and installed 2 items

 - **JetBrains Toolbox App:** JetBrain is the name of a company that makes software for developers. JetBrains Toolbox is an app that is like a software manager for all JetBrain's products. It lets you launch their IDE's and your software projects in one spot. It also lets you easily update all the IDE's in one spot.
 
 - **PyCharm:** an IDE that has all the tools required for a person or team to write, test, and run many different types of Python programs.
 
We still need to download one more piece of software so you can actually write Python programs.

 - [ ] Download [Python 3.6 SDK](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure you select Python 3.6+ (NOT 2.7+). 
 - [ ] Install Python 3.6. Use all default locations for installation!

### Quick review of last week's homework

- [ ] Base-10 uses the numerals `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. What are the numerals of `Hexidecimal`?
- [ ] Binary numbers use the prefix `0b`. What is the prefix of `Hexidecimal` numbers?

- [ ] Give me 3 examples of the following `int`, `float`, `char`, `string`, `byte` <br /> **Example of integer is `1`**

#### Base Conversions Review

Computers only read bytes. A 32-bit computer will read 4 bytes at a time (8 bits * 4 = 32 bits). An 8-bit computer will only read 1 byte at a time. 

- [ ] Step 1: Give the decimal number `195` as a 1-byte binary number.
- [ ] Step 2: Convert the 1 byte number above to 2 bytes.
- [ ] Step 3: Convert the 1 byte number above to 3 bytes.

-----------

- [ ] Step 1: Give the number `31415962` as a 4-byte number.<br />**Note: Use Microsoft Calculator or Google Search to convert this number.**
- [ ] Step 2: Convert the 4 byte number `314159623` to 1 byte. 
- [ ] Step 3: Convert the 1 byte binary number above to decimal (`314159623` as 1 bytes to decimal) <br />**Note: the number will change and will become a different and smaller number. It will NOT have the decimal value of `314159623` anymore.**

Compare the above 1st three answers with the last three answers.
- [ ] What COULD happen to the decimal value if you convert a 4 byte number into a 3 byte (or 2 byte or 1 byte) number? Is that good or bad?
- [ ] What COULD happen to the decimal value if you convert a 1 byte number into a 2 byte (or 3 byte or 4 byte) number? Is that good or bad?

### Quick review of last week's videos

This is a 1-question review of [Crash Course Computer Science #6: Registers & RAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpnE6UAfbtU), [Crash Course Computer Science #7: CPU & Clock Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZGugFqdr60), and [Crash Course Computer Science #8: Instructions & Programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zltgXvg6r3k)

`Registers` are small, indiviudal memory units that store just 1 byte of information (4 bytes for 32-bit machines). These are `Register A`, `Register B`, `Register C`, and `Register D` in the picture below. The "control unit" of the CPU only see these 4 registers. The control unit cannot see RAM.

`RAM` is called "Random Access Memory". It is a huge array of memory that stores programs and data. They allow for fast and easy access of any memory address byte value. Computers, nowadays, have 8GB or more of RAM memory.

 `Machine code` is what computers "speak". In order for a computer to do something, machine code needs to be put in a computers RAM. You saw this in an earlier video. Check out the `RAM` in the picture below...
 
 ![screenshot_2017-11-24-20-07-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8707125/33544552-92df19f2-d91e-11e7-837a-32208696e0df.png)
 
 `Assembly code` is a version of machine code that uses some English words with memory locations ("Load_A 14" or "Add B A"). Early programmers always programmed using Assembly code. You also saw this in an earlier video. Check out the `RAM` in the picture below...
 
 ![screenshot_2017-12-04-17-33-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8707125/33544542-8516a646-d91e-11e7-8fe2-821cd591a464.png)
 
 **Note:** Assembly code never gets stored in RAM! Only Machine Code (zeros and ones) gets stored in RAM. This picture is just an abstraction to help see what happens without converting all the binary numbers into "opcodes" and "memory addresses".
 
 - [ ] What is the difference between the `RAM` on both pictures? Both pictures have the same code; one is machine code and the other is Assembly code, but what is different between the two.
 
 ### Programming Languages
 
 Here is a summary of what programming languages are and why they were created.
 
 - [ ] Watch [Crash Course Computer Science #11: Programming Languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU1u-js7db8)
 
 - [ ] Pay attention to keywords such as `Assembler`, and `Compiler`. Listen to what they are and the difference between them!
 - [ ] At 8:58, there is a snippet of text displayed in the video. Write the snippet down (19 words).
 
 Late in the video (9:25 and later), they list a lot of programming languages by decade. 
  - [ ] What are programming langauges that were created in the 1960's
  - [ ] ...1970's
  - [ ] ...1980's
  - [ ] ...1990's
  - [ ] ...2000's and 2010's
 
 #### Review of Video #11
 As you can see from the above pictures, there is a `one-to-one` relationship between `Machine code` and  `Assembly code`. That means that **one line** of Assembly code gives **one line** of Machine code. With Assembly code, you tell the computer to work with memory (`LOAD_A 14` - "Load byte value at RAM address 14 into register A", or `Store_A 13` - "Store byte value in register A into RAM address 13"). 
 
 This is what a `low-level language` is. Low-level programming languages have you working with memory at a very detailed level. They take Assembly code and use an `Assembler` to convert it into machine code.
 
 `High-level language`s are human readable and kind of read like English sentences. They hide the detail of the memory from the programmer by using `variables` and `control flow`. One line of a high-level programming language will result in many lines of machine code. This `one-to-many` lines of code is done by a `compiler`.
 
The following picture will show the difference between low-level and high-level programming languages. Keep in mind that Assembly code does NOT get stored in RAM. Only Machine code (zeros and ones) get stored in RAM!

![screenshot_2017-12-04-18-51-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8707125/33547112-4b5d8b1a-d926-11e7-8404-a1071ebb483b.png)
 
 Notice that Assembly Code uses 7 lines of code (Line 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, and 15), but Python code only uses 3 lines of code. They are exactly the same code, but use different languages!!
 
 ### Statements and Functions
 
 Here is a summary of basic programming ideas that you must understand. These are the most basic of ideas. You will use all of these ideas over and over again! Go over this video 2 or 3 time if you must.
 
 **Note:** Python has a different "grammar" (syntax) then what is shown in the video below. 
 - [ ] Watch [Crash Course Computer Science #12: Statement & Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26oaHV7D40)
 
 Define the following
 - [ ] `Assignment Statement` + example code
 - [ ] `Variable` + What do you think a variable represents? Think of the last few videos!
 - [ ] `Initialize` + What do you initialize?
 - [ ] `Control Flow Statements`
 - [ ] `Conditional` + example code
 - [ ] `Function` + example code + `Return Statement` (**Note:** around 3/4 way through video)
 - [ ] `Libraries` (**Note:** near end of video)
 
 #### Programming Statements
 What is the general format of the following Conditional / Control-Flow Statements. Also give example usage.
 - [ ] `If Statement` (3:23 - general format. 3:28 - example usage)
 - [ ] `If-Else Statement` (3:44 - example usage only)
 
 **Note:** With all `If Statements`, there are no loops. It decides if it should 
 
 - [ ] `While Statement` (4:20 - general format. 4:44 - example usage)
 - [ ] `For Loop` (5:53 - general format. 6:52 - example usage) 
 
 **Note:** With all `While Statement`s and `For Loop`s, your code could loop many times!!

### Types

So far you know about a few types

 1. **Integers** which are also called **ints** for short. They are *numbers* that contain the numerals `0 - 9` only.
 2. **Floating-point Numbers** which are called **floats**. They are *numbers* that contain the numerals `0 - 9` AND one decimal-point `.`
 3. **Strings** which are text. They are lists of *characters* that can contain `letters`, `numbers`, `spaces`, `symbols`, and text from other languages. 
 
 As a side note Strings NEED to be inside of...
 
  - `'...'` **single quotes** 
  - `"..."` **double quotes** 
  - `'''...'''` **triple single quotes** 
  - `"""..."""` **triple double quotes** 
  
 ### Operations 
 
 All the basic operators in Python work with numbers (`int`s and `float`s).
 
 Here are a list of the Operators. 
 
 - [ ] For `Python Result`, I want you to use Python to figure out the answer! For Addition, type into Python `print(22 + 7)` and write the answer in the empty space
 
 | Operation        | Python  | Python Result | Math   | 
 | ---------------- | :-----: | :-----------: | :----: |
 | Addition         | 22 + 7  |             | 22 + 7
 | Subtraction      | 22 - 7  |             | 22 - 7
 | Multiplication   | 22 * 7  |            | ![22 multipled by 7](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?22&space;\times&space;7)
 | Division         | 22 / 7  |  | ![22 divided by 7](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?22&space;\div&space;7)
 | Integer Division | 22 // 7 |              | ![Floor of 22 divided by 7](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left&space;\lfloor&space;22&space;\div&space;7&space;\right&space;\rfloor)
 | Modulo           | 22 % 7  |              | 22 mod 7
 | Exponent         | 22 ** 7 |     | ![22 to the power of 7](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?22^{7})
 
 The above all work on numbers, but two of them also work with `strings`!
 
 - [ ] Which of the above operators work with `Strings`? Give an example of each. Also, what is the output out each?
 
 ### Functions
 
 You have learned from GrokLearning of 4 built-in Python functions plus one additional function from the teacher
 
 1. `print()`
 2. `input()`
 3. `len()`
 4. `int()`
 5. `float()`
 
 - [ ] What do the above 5 functions do? Try to describe as much as possible. 
 - [ ] What are the input `types` of each function? What goes between the parentheses `()`. Do `int`s work? `float`s? `String`s? All `String`s or special ones? What if there are no inputs?
 - [ ] What is the one output `type` of each function?
