 ### Review the 'Crash Course: Computer Science' videos 
 
 - [ ] [#1 (Early Computing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI), 
 - [ ] [#2 (Electronic Computing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN0ucKNX0hc), 
 - [ ] [#3 (Boolean Logic & Logic Gates)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI-qXk7XojA)
   
 ### Answer question 
 
 Based on the above 'Crash Course: Computer Science' videos , answer the following question
    
  - [ ] Why is binary (2-states) better in computers compared to 3-states or 5-states? <br />**2 accetable answers**
  - [ ] Why is 5-states better than 2-states? <br /> **Opinion question**
  - [ ] What number of states do you think the English letters are in?  <br /> **Opinion question. Don't think too much**
    
 In *Math* the **values** are `numbers` and **operations** are `+`, `-`, `ร`, `รท`, etc. So...
  - [ ] For *Boolean Algebra*, what are the **values** and **operations**?
    
 Give the **Logic Tables** for the following operators. Use the tables below for help
  - [ ] `And` operators
  - [ ] `Or` operators
  - [ ] `Not` operators
    
  Here is the template for the NOT operator
  
  | Input | Output |
  | :---: | :----: |
  | false |        |
  | true  |        |
  
  Here is the combined template for the AND and OR operators
  
  | Input 1 | Input 2 | Output <br />And | Output <br />Or |
  | :-----: | :-----: | :--------------: | :-------------: |
  | false   | false   |                  |                 |  
  | false   | true    |                  |                 | 
  | true    | false   |                  |                 | 
  | true    | true    |                  |                 | 
  
  Moving onto Transistors...
  - [ ] What are transistors?
  - [ ] What are Logic gates? <br /> **2 possible answers**
  - [ ] What are the 3 Logic gates talked about in the video?
