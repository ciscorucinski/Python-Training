# Teaching Themes

Over the course of the class, I intend to go over the following themes.

## Computational Thinking

**Computational Thinking** is the process by which we use our knowledge of what computers can do in order for them to help solve problems. It is learning to think in ways which allow us, as humans, to solve problems more effectively and, when appropriate, use computers to help us do so. The power of computational thinking is that it applies to every other type of reasoning and allows people to think creatively and critically.

The following points will be broken down into components that will allow students to understand how to take large ideas and turn them into easily understandable parts that can easily be managed and acted on. Students can apply these concepts to many different fields and ideas; however, they will be applied to programming in this class. 

### Parts of Computational Thinking
 1. **Decomposition** - the process of breaking down a big problem into more manageable segments.
 2. **Pattern Recognition** - the ability to identify similarities in something.
 3. **Abstraction** - is about understanding what you really need and what you can leave out. It is about simplifying from the concrete to the general as solutions are developed.
 4. **Algorithms** - are a sequence of instructions or a set of rules to get something down. There are always clear starting and ending conditions that have to be met.
 5. **Debugging** - is the essentional component in all learning by correcting and learning from mistakes.
 
 ## Python Language
 
 During this part of the class, the students will learn about the Python Langauge. This will also include aspects of computer programming in general.
 
 I am dividing it into 3 major parts.
 
 1. Basics
 2. Small Projects
 3. Single Big Project
